RESO::ConstructionMaterial	FoamInsulation	Foam Insulation	Spray foam or foam-in-place insulation can be sprayed into walls, on attic surfaces, or under floors to insulate and reduce air leakage. There are two types of foam-in-place insulation: closed-cell and open-cell. Both are typically made with polyurethane. Closed-cell foam has a greater insulation value and provides stronger resistance against moisture and air leakage. Open-cell foam is lighter and less expensive but should not be used below ground level where it could absorb water.	https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/Foam+Insulation

RESO::ConstructionMaterial	IcatRecessedLighting	ICAT Recessed Lighting	ICAT recessed light fixtures are rated both to safely come in contact with insulation and are better airsealed. ICAT is an acronym for Insulation Contact/AirTight. They can be installed safely with insulation and air sealing. These lights are different from IC (Insulation Contact) fixtures, which are not very airtight. They can also be identified by the wording “Washington State Approved.” Documentation on the installation is recommended because ICAT rating often requires multiple components be used as specified by the manufacturer. Substitutions of components can negate the rating.

RESO::CurrentFinancing	LeasedRenewables	Leased Renewables	Definition:  Renewable system (i.e., solar or wind) belonging to a third-party is installed on a customer’s property at little or no cost to the property owner. Property owner has entered an agreement to pay for the lease of the equipment. Structure:  Fee model is based on equipment to generate power, not power itself.  Transfer: If requirements are met it may be possible to transfer lease from home seller to buyer with the approval of the system owner. If being transferred, see Fannie Mae guidelines for more info: since lease is for equipment it must be included in the buyers DTI calculation.  If a buyer cannot or will not adopt a lease, then the seller is required to pay the remaining contract amount in full and the system would be removed.Real or Personal Property:  Renewable system is typically considered personal property.  All tax credits as well as maintenance responsibilities, etc. belong to the third-party owner. Some leases require the homeowner to pay the personal property tax.  Terms:  Lease should provide items homeowner is responsible for paying. In a solar lease model, a customer will sign a contract with an installer/developer and pay for the solar energy equipment over a period of years or decades. Solar leases can be structured so customers pay no up-front costs, some up-front costs (partially prepaid) or can be fully prepaid (the leasing company is then able to depreciate the equipment over time and offers a lower fee for pre-paid leases).  The homeowner may have the option to purchase the system during or at the end of the lease term (most leases are for 20-year terms) at its fair market value or terms set in the original lease contract.	https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/Leased+Renewables

RESO::CurrentFinancing	PowerPurchaseAgreement	Power Purchase Agreement	Definition:  Renewable system belonging to a third-party is installed on a customer’s property at little or no up-front cost to the property owner. Property owner is in an agreement to buy all the power generated at a fixed rate whether it is actually used or not.  This is typically lower than the local utility rate. Structure:  Fee model is based on power, not equipment to generate it. Transfer: A PPA may be transferred to a homebuyer with approval from the system owner. If a buyer will not adopt a PPA, then the seller is required to pay the remaining contract amount in full and the system would be removed. If being transferred, see Fannie Mae guidelines for more info:  portion of the purchase towards equipment must be included in the buyers DTI calculation.  Real or Personal Property: Renewable system is typically considered personal property.  All tax credits as well as maintenance responsibilities, etc. belong to the third-party owner. Terms: The customer agrees to purchase all energy produced by the system.  At the end of the PPA contract term (usually between 10-25 years), property owners can extend the contract and even buy the solar energy system from the developer based on terms in the contract.Additional info on SEIA.org.	https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/Power+Purchase+Agreement

RESO::CurrentFinancing	PropertyAssessedCleanEnergy	Property-Assessed Clean Energy	Definition: Property-assessed clean energy (PACE) is a financing tool for property owners to fund energy or water efficiency or renewable energy installations. Structure: PACE is a secured loan that attaches to the property as a voluntary assessment on the property taxes.  To be eligible for a PACE loan, the building must be located in a local jurisdiction where the City or County has passed a resolution to participate in a PACE program. PACE financing is often a public-private partnership between a private finance company and a public agency.Transfer? The loan may be transferred to the new owner upon sale of the property with the approval of the system owner. Real or Personal Property? If seller owns and not a third-party, then renewable system is typically considered real property and tax credits and maintenance requirements, etc. belong to the property owner.  Terms:  Loan terms can vary between 5 and 30 years. Some programs also allow PACE to finance solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs). Due to the complexities of PACE financing, NAR and states like California have provided statements which are worth further consideration.

To calculate a home's HERS Index Score, a certified RESNET home energy rater will do a home energy rating and compare the data against a reference home (a design-modeled home of the same size and shape as the actual home), so the HERS Index Score is always relative to the size, shape, and type of the house.

RESO::GreenBuildingVerificationType	HomeEnergyScore	Home Energy Score	The Home Energy Score, managed by the US DOE, is a national system that allows homes to receive an energy efficiency rating, similar to the MPG rating available for cars. The Home Energy Score uses a 10-point scale to reflect how much energy a home is expected to use under standard operating conditions. Homes that are expected to use the least amount of energy (and are considered the most energy efficient) score a 10, and homes that are expected to use the most amount of energy (and are considered the least energy efficient) score a 1. The Home Energy Score uses a standard calculation method and takes into account the home's structure and envelope (walls, windows, foundation) and its heating, cooling, and hot water systems. Only Qualified Assessors who pass a DOE exam are allowed to provide the Home Energy Score.	https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW17/Home+Energy+Score
